# CO2_reduction 
Passenger Cars and Freight traffic are two important emission sources of CO2.
Emissions of passengger cars are reduced by improved engines and more efficient exhaust treatment.
Replacement of elder vehicles by modern cars results in reduced emission.
The rate of reduction can be increased by eliminating elderly vehicles.
Efficiency and exhaust treatment for  heavy duty vehicles have reached technology limits. This means 
that load traffic emissions will develop proportional to traffic performance measured in tkm.
Therefor it is important to forecast loadtraffic. One primary factor driving load traffic is gross domestic product (BIP).
One supplementary means can be the replacement of fossile fuels through synthetic fuels manufactured from green plants.
Prediction of the replacement rate of passenger cars and shift of road transport to rail are two efficient means to reduce CO2 emission
